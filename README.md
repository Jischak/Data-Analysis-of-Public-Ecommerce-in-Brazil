# Data-Analysis-of-Public-Ecommerce-in-Brazil
Data analysis of Public E-commerce in Brazil. What was analyzed? Category Product Analysis and so on.

All my code, I run on Google Collab. But if you want to run it on local (using a jupyter notebook or something else) you have to verify:
1. Check your python version, I used 3.10.12 for testing
2. Install prerequisites like pandas (v1.5.3)
